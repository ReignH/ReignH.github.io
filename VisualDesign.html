<h3> Artist statement: I wanted to showcase my ability to be creative and open-minded.When creating my pixel art I wanted to give myself a challenge so I picked an image that I probably wouldn't have picked. I wanted to show different colors. You’ll see colors like green, white and different shades of pink to create balance. I enjoyed seeing a landscape of a pink tree because I feel like it's rare to see, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to explore creating something different. When creating my landscape I thought about a color scheme to add texture, and creativity.

<h3> Artist statement: In this portrait I used Beyonce as my main subject. She’s a well known celebrity and I admire her hard work and dedication so that is why I chose to do a portrait of her. I included a bold blue text with the name BEYONCE in all bold. I copied and pasted her name a couple times and slanted it. I used the pen tool to trace her face and dress.</h3>
