<h3> Welcome everyone! My name is Reign and i'm a senior in highschool</h3>
<h4> I've had work experience revolving around coding, graphic design, computer work and more!</h4>	
<h4> Each year in highschool I had a coding class. During my 11th grade year and now currently I joined an internship for coding. First Girls Who Code and now American on Tech. Having to do a coding/technology class each year has taught me a lot about coding and enhanced my computer/technical skills as well.</h4>	
	
	
	<h4> Some of the basics I learned is adding photos, adding links, chanigng the background color, and adding vidoes.</h4>
