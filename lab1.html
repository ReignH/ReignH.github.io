<h2><p style="background-color:Tomato;">Hi, my name is Reign and my favorite subject is ELA</h2></p>
	
	
	
	 <h2>One word I would use to describe me, would probably be hardworking.</h2>
 
 
 <h2> I enjoy ELA because I like writing and I find the subject Interesting. I also enjoy reading. <h2>
 
 
 <br> One subject I never liked, Is math because I've never been the best at It. <br>
 
 <p> One of my favorite things to eat would be ribs. <p>
